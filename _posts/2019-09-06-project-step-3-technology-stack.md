After a lot of research I have decided on using the MERN-Stack for my first web application. 

## What are the technologies in the MERN stack?
* **M**ongoDB: A document-based open source database
* **E**xpress: A JS framework designed to develop web applications and APIs
* **R**eact: A JS library for building user interfaces
* **N**ode.js: A JS runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JS engine

## MongoDB
MongoDB is the database system used in the MERN stack. See <a href="https://winnekes.github.io/project-step-2-sql-or-nosql/">Project Step #2: SQL or NoSQL?</a>

## ExpressJS
Writing a web server on Node.js directly is not that easy, this is where Express comes in. Express is a framework that simplifies the task of writing your server code. I compared setting up a server in Node.js with setting one up in Express, it is so much more straightforward with Express.


## React
React is a JS library for building UI components, especially for single-page applications. React is based on the concept of components and reusability, it's supposed to be fast, scalable, and simple.
React allows developers to create large web applications which can change data, without having to reload the page. This seems perfect for my purpose: a single-page calendar that you're able to modify instantly without having to go through multiple pages.


## Node.js
Node.js is based on Google's V8 JavaScript engine which is used in the Chrome browsers. It includes various modules that provides features essential for implementing web applications – including networking protocols such as HTTP. It basically allows you to use JavaScript for your backend, too!

## But why MERN and not LAMP, MEAN, etc.?
React, Express and Node.js are all based on JavaScript - which means that every single line code that I will write is going to be in one language. MongoDB stores my data in the JSON (JS Object Notation) documents.
There is no need to switch contexts going from client-side to server-side, using a single language also lets me share code between these technologies.

My goal is to present SimplyShift by the end of this month and sticking to the MERN stack is going to make this very possible.
